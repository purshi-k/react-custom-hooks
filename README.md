Custom hooks are those re-usable hooks which can be created to do some repeated tasks like http call/debounce etc

Reusability — we can use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.
Clean Code — extracting all the component logic into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.
Maintainability — easier to maintain. if we need to change the logic of the hook, we only need to change it once.
Great Community — there is a good chance somebody already created the hook you're thinking of. The web is filled with a ton of Custom Hooks! you can find a hook for your need and use it as-is or even better — you can use it as a starting point and make it awesome!
